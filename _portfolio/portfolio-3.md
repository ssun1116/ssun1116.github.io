- Title: Gene regulatory network reveals the landscape of myeloid dendritic cell differentiation
    - Summary: Presented the use of single-cell analysis workflows (public dataset integration, gene regulatory network construction, and DEG analysis) to investigate dendritic cell differentiation. This work helped me build proficiency in single-cell RNA-seq analysis.
