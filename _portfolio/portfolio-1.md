This poster presents a comprehensive single-cell atlas of the developing human brain, showcasing dynamic gene expression patterns across various developmental stages. Utilizing data from 393,060 cells and eight integrated datasets, the study highlights the cellular and temporal specificity of neurological disorder risk genes, including those associated with autism, schizophrenia, and other brain disorders.

Key findings include distinct temporal expression patterns of autism risk genes, such as MEF2C, and the identification of sex-specific differences in IL17RD expression, linked to maternal immune activation (MIA) susceptibility. The research also unveils transcriptional regulatory networks, emphasizing the role of transcription factors like MEF2C in early brain development and their association with disorder-risk gene expression.

This work aims to bridge gaps in understanding the interplay between brain development and neurological disorders, offering valuable insights for future studies on the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these conditions.

By providing an open-access dataset, this study encourages the research community to further explore the complex developmental trajectories of neurological disorders, promoting a deeper understanding of human brain development and its vulnerabilities.
