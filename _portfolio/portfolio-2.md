- Title: Dysregulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin Signaling Pathway via Rnf146 Upregulation in a VPA-Induced Mouse Model of Autism Spectrum Disorder
    - Summary: This poster presented findings on how prenatal exposure to valproic acid impacts neurodevelopment through RNF146-mediated dysregulation of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway in a mouse model of autism spectrum disorder.
