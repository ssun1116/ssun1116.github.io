This study introduces a single-cell atlas of the developing human brain, spanning 393,060 cells from fetal stages to adulthood. It reveals the temporal and spatial dynamics of disorder risk genes, providing insights into brain development and its connection to neurological disorders, and serves as a valuable resource for neurodevelopmental research.
