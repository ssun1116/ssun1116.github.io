This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using a valproic acid (VPA)-induced mouse model. High-resolution mass spectrometry-based proteomic analysis of the prefrontal cortex revealed significant dysregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway due to the upregulation of Rnf146, a key regulator of this pathway. Overexpression of Rnf146 in the prefrontal cortex impaired social behaviors in mice, increased excitatory synaptic transmission, and altered synaptic organization, providing insights into how environmental factors like prenatal VPA exposure contribute to ASD pathogenesis. These findings suggest Rnf146 and the Wnt/β-catenin pathway as potential targets for therapeutic intervention.
