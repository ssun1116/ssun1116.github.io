This study investigates autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using a VPA-induced mouse model, uncovering that Rnf146 upregulation disrupts the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in the prefrontal cortex. This dysregulation impairs social behaviors, increases excitatory synaptic transmission, and alters synaptic organization, identifying Rnf146 as a potential therapeutic target.
