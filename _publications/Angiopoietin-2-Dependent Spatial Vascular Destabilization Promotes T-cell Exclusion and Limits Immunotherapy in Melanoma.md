This study identifies Angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) as a key driver of immune evasion in melanoma by destabilizing vasculature. High ANGPT2 levels were linked to T-cell exclusion, while targeting ANGPT2 improved vascular integrity, T-cell infiltration, and immunotherapy effectiveness, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target.
