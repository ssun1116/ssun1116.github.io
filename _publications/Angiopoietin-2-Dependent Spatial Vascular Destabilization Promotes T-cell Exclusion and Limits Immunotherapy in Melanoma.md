This study reveals the role of Angiopoietin-2 (ANGPT2) in promoting immune evasion in melanoma through vascular destabilization. Elevated ANGPT2 levels were associated with T-cell exclusion from tumor cores in both human and murine melanoma models. Targeting ANGPT2 via genetic or pharmacologic methods enhanced vascular integrity, facilitated CD8+ T-cell infiltration, and improved the efficacy of immune checkpoint therapies. These findings highlight ANGPT2 as a promising therapeutic target to overcome resistance in melanoma immunotherapy.
