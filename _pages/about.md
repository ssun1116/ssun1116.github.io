The intricate process of brain development, driven by genetic interactions, shapes cognitive function and the onset of neurological disorders. 
My research uses bioinformatics to map these genetic landscapes, focusing on how gene expression changes over time can reveal critical intervention points. 
I aim to expand this work by integrating CRISPR-based functional genomics to directly manipulate and investigate the effects of risk genes in neurodevelopmental pathways.

Currently, my interests focuses on:
	•	Developing single-cell atlases to trace gene dynamics in brain development
	•	Utilizing CRISPR technology to explore the functional roles of disorder-associated genes
