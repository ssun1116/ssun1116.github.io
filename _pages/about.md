The intricate process of brain development, driven by genetic interactions, shapes cognitive function and, at times, leads to the risk of neurological disorders. I am interested in combining bioinformatics with neuroscience to map the genetic landscapes of the brain and explore how gene regulation influences neurodevelopmental pathways. My goal is to uncover the roles of risk genes and identify potential intervention points by applying CRISPR-based functional genomics and integrating isoform-level transcriptomics. I aim to advance our understanding of brain complexity and contribute to strategies for mitigating neurodevelopmental disorders.

My research interests focus on:

* Neurodevelopmental Processes and Neurological Disorders
* Single-cell RNA Sequencing and Isoform-level RNA Biology
* CRISPR-based Functional Genomics and Therapeutic Gene Inverventions
* Human Brain Organoid Modeling and Advanced Neurodevelopmental Studies
